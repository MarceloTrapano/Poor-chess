# Poor-chess
It was my project for programming classes. WARNING: Spaghetti code.
Tutor told us to write a program which uses regex, classes, class inheritance and exceptions. My idea was to create a chess game in pygame library. To play this version of chess user has to know chess notation. Pieces moves when user input correct chess move. For example to move pawn to e4 square user has to input e4. Program checks if move is legal or not. If move is not legal user has to input move again.
Unfortrunately project is not completed, but it was enough to get good grade.
Working elements of the game:
-every piece can move independently
-turn changes with every move
-castle works
-en passant works
-when two same pieces attack same square program knows which piece to move
-pawn can move two square from starting position
-knight can jump over pieces
-pieces cannot take same color pieces
-rook, queen and bishop cannot jump over pieces
This was my first big project and I know how unreadable some of the parts are. A lot of functions and classes are in Polish language and I did not expect to publish this project. I think that I should seperate this code to multiple files for clarity.

Thanks for reading.
